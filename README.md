<h1>My Game Engine</h1>

 ### [YouTube Demonstration](https://youtu.be/xkbgqPWuLDg?si=oZgbgN5RiNjxTZl_)

<h2>Description</h2>
The project is my own game engine which I have created using the SDL library. It has an alien world setting, with a few models - most static, but a few animated. It was carefully
coded and optimized to ensure good performance (at least 60 FPS).
